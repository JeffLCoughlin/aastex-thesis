%% Thesis file for NMSU Astronomy Dept. Thesises...Thesi...Theses...ya know that thing you exchange for a degree.
% Last edited May 2012 by J. Coughlin. % jlcough@nmsu.edu
% Requires the following packages (which should be default in your latex installation): latexsym, graphicx, amssym, natbib, verbatim, caption.
% If you use \includegraphics then you will also need graphics, and if you use epsfig you will also need epsfit, and likely epstopdf for pdflatex.
% In testing there was some issues with mac users and the caption package, so I have included the needed caption*.sty files with this distro just in case to override the system default.

\documentclass[12pt,preprint]{aastex-thesis}  % Using a custom-modified version of aastex v5.2. Need to use preprint style. (You can do preprint2 for double-column if you want for reading over - the bulk of thesis will come out okay in 2 columns but some pages won't, like the header pages and ToC).  Default is 12pt for NMSU thesis. Note this means that /normalsize is 12pt, /footnotesize is 10pt, /small is 11pt, /scriptsize is 8 pt. Having footnotes 10pt complies with NMSU thesis guidelines.

\usepackage{epsfig}  % Allows you to use epsfig, of course.
\usepackage{epstopdf}  % Converts eps files to pdf on the fly - have to have to work with pdflatex.
%\usepackage{endfloat}  % If you uncomment this line, it moves all the figures to the end of the paper. Useful if you want to print thesis without figures in the way for proofreading or whatever
\usepackage{graphics}  % Need if using /includegraphics, but not if using all /epsfig. Doesn't hurt to include though.
\usepackage{natbib}  % Gotta have for bibtex of course.
\usepackage{iondefs} % Definitions of ion symbols if you work with ions a lot...isn't it little ionic? don't ya think? just a little ionic. Like a thousand tables, when all you need is a figure...
\usepackage{listings}  % Package to directly include source code in the document. E.x.  \lstinputlisting{MyProg.cpp}
