\subsection{Observing an Exowhale}
\label{exowhaleobs}

We observed a certain star with an exoplanet through a telescope. In Figure~\ref{whalefig1} we plot a theoretical star-whale system. 

\begin{figure}  % No [] option should make the figure take up its own page

\epsfig{width=\linewidth,file=whalefig1.eps}
\caption[Whales are Everywhere (short caption example)]{An illustration of a system containing a star, shown on the left, and a whale, shown on the right, separated by a distance $a$, not to scale. The star and whale lie at distances of $r_{\star}$ and $r_{p}$, respectively, from the barycenter of the system, which is marked via a ``+'' symbol. Similarly, the star and whale lie at distances of $s_{\star}$ and $s_{p}$, respectively, from the photocenter of the system, which is marked via a ``$\times$'' symbol. All distances are sky-projected distances along the semi-major axis of the system, and thus are independent of the system's inclination. Note that although in this illustration the photocenter is to the left of the barycenter, it can lie anywhere between the star and whale.}

\begin{figure}[h]  % Adding [h] will tell latex to place the figure with text if it can and looks good. If it can't place it with text (too big), then it goes to the end of the chapter and you will have to go back to [] or []h!]

\section{Further Whale Observations}

We get into detail about exowhales.

\subsection{Whales and You: What you Need to Know}

A subsection on whales and you.

\subsubsection{Whales: The Noisy Killer}

Everyone can hear you scream underwater.

\paragraph{Whale Colors}

A paragraph, (what you might want to label a subsubsubsection), and whale chromotography. We could go as deep in sections as a subparagraph, but, well, let's not.

Instead let's show a rotated deluxetable on whales with errorbars in Table~\ref{modelresultstab}.
