The number of known extrasolar planets, planets that orbit stars other than our own Sun, has dramatically increased in recent years. Recently much theoretical work has shown that whales could exist on these planets, i.e., exowhales. In this thesis we present overwhelming evidence for the existance of exowhales, and conclude their favorite food is exoplankton.
