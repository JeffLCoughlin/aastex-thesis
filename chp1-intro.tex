\subsection{Exoplanets}
\label{introsec}

The field of exoplanets is exciting, as shown by \citet{Borucki2011}. In this thesis I present evidence for whales on exoplanets. I back up my claim with really bad statistics.

In \S\ref{whalesec} we talk in extensive detail about the biology and presumed intelligence of the discovered whales.

We conclude that we should worship these exowhales as our benevolant overlords, (see Chapter~\ref{chap2}).

Whales are the gentle giants of the sea. Their natural enemy is the harpoon. It's theorized by \citet{Coughlin2008} that they could exist in the upper atmosphers of exoplanets\footnote{Via the use of magic and JRAF}.
