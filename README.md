# aastex-thesis
Modification of the aastex style file for use in meeting NMSU thesis guidelines

What I did was to modify the original, current aastex.sty style file
to conform to the NMSU thesis guidelines, and call it
aastex-thesis.sty. I've ensured all margins, table/figure/numbering,
line spacing, appendices, automatic table of contents, list of tables,
and list of figures, etc. etc., are all correct as to the current NMSU
thesis guidelines. The benefits of this are that deluxetable will work
perfectly as it does for your regularly submitted papers, all
astronomy journal commands are all included, all aastex symbols are
included by default, aastex plotting (epsfig, includegraphics,
plotone, plottwo, etc.) works, so in the end you can just paste in
papers, or write it up like you would a normal astronomy paper, and
BAM, thesis done.

These files contain a minimal working example of a thesis, and is
compile-able as is. (The subject is exo-whales - you know they're out
there! ;)  I've commented nearly every line of the latex code with
exactly what it does and is for, so it should be really easy to use
and understand, and if need be, modify.

Just pdflatex main.tex and it should all work.

Cheers,
Jeff
