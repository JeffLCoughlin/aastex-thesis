\section{\MakeUppercase{Whale Phase Dispersion Minimization (WPDM)}}

In this appendix we further explain the WPDM technique introduced in Section~\ref{exowhaleobs}. Equations show whales exist. 

\begin{equation}
p = \frac{T}{P} - int(\frac{T}{P})
\end{equation}

where $p$ is the phase of a given point, with a time value, $T$, for a given period, $P$, and int() returns the argument rounded down to the nearest integer value.

Did you know that this won't show up as listed in the table of contents, in accordance with NMSU thesis policy? Exciting.
